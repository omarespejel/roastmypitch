# Description:
# This script generates a comprehensive prompt for an LLM by concatenating key source
# files from both the Python backend and the Next.js frontend, along with project
# configuration and directory structure.
#
# Usage:
# ./generate-context.sh
#

# --- Configuration ---

# Get current date for the output filename
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)

# Output filename with a timestamp
OUTPUT_FILE="project-context-prompt-${DATE}.txt"

# --- Script Body ---
